Depending on the sport, it is possible that there is the need for a video where the student shows all his sporting qualities. It is important to mention that all athletes must undergo a registration process in the American University leagues (NCAA / NAIA) to evaluate their status as an amateur player. This process must be taken very seriously since their eligibility may be affected by these results. Bekdos will also advise them on everything related to this process with the University leagues.

  { title: "How is the whole subject of translation and certification of grades handled for international transcripts?", content: "Universities ask for the grades to be sent directly to them from the educational institution, sealed in an envelope from the school or university.

  { title: "Do you handle student visas with the US Embassy for international students?", content: "BEKDOS is responsible for counseling you during all the student visa process and ensures that all our students are prepared for the appointment at the Embassy. We know the processes and know what the most important points to take into consideration are, our experienced staff is 100% prepared and trained to guide them on everything related to the handling and approval of student visas."},
  { title: "How is the registration process for the NCAA / NAIA?", content: "This process of registration with the NCAA / NAIA only applies to those students who have an interest in participating in sporting activities at the University. The registration process is not very complicated but it is important to understand that the results of this assessment will determine your eligibility (years available to play), so it must be treated very seriously. A negative decision by the league could complicate the negotiation of the scholarship with the coaches."},
